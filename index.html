					<h2> Why html default style is ugly? </h2>
					<p>
						<mark>Who knows</mark>, maybe performance, maybe history, but i knows one thing for sure,
						using <code>class="alert alert-primary"</code> can't be the solution.
						Why am i using a ton of <strong>classes</strong> and <strong>ids</strong> to style
						simple components?
					</p>
					<p>
						Lot's of questions around web developement these days, but answers started rising on the horizon.
					</p>
					<p>
						My goal is to show my solution to many many problems. First, i'll point out some of these problems, 
						than i'll give you a possible solution 
						(at <kbd>ctrl+shift+i</kbd> > Elements > Head > 
							<code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="base.css"&gt;</code>, and this whole document is just a tech demo 
							about how powerfull can it be).

					<h2>No more jquery?</h2>
					<p>
						The new version of bootstrap 
						<a href="https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/bootstrap-5/">stops using jquery</a>
						and this is the good direction. Jquery is unneccessary and we 
						<a href="https://hashnode.com/post/why-do-many-web-developers-hate-jquery-ciibz8fp801g9j3xtgx19utpe">
							really don't need it.</a>

					<h2>Classes classes classes...</h2>
					<p>
						In theory we have <strong>components</strong> for the most usecases,
						and <code>div</code>, <code>span</code> for special cases. In real life we have <code>divs</code>,
						<code>spans</code>, and <code>classes</code>,
						and sometimes <code>sections</code>, <code>heads</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						These days we have many many 
						<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">
							tags with semantic meaning</a>,
						but special behavior is missing.
						The layout spice still missing from these components, and this is the reason we use
					</p>
					<code>
						&lt;div class="col-4"&gt;
					</code>
					<h2> Div forest </h2>
					<p>
						My other pain is the <strong>huge markup</strong> for every single component.
						when you see 10 divs, and the result is a simple layout with a coumple of components.
					</p>

					<h2>Solution?</h3>
					<p>
						In my opinion <strong>Bootstrap</strong> can't be it. 
						More like an <i>"extension"</i> for the default style.
						Like <code>base.css</code>, this is actually an experiment about it.
						A couple hundered lines of css addition to the default beaviors, based on 
						tagnames and relations between them.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can see, i'm that 
						<a href="https://www.motherfuckingwebsite.com">
							motherfucker</a> person, but this is the way to make fast, simple, and not ugly websites.
						Html is rich. We can use it to make our website more colorfull with minimal styling.
						Better to have a nice colorfull website, but also better to keep it simple as possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						You should use <code>classes</code> but frameworks should not.
						You have to build your layout with <strong>Grid</strong>/<strong>Flexbox</strong>, 
						but browsers should give you some default options,
						only with html tags for simpler designs.
