					<h1> Why html default style is ugly? </h1>
					<p>
						Who knows, maybe performance, maybe history, but i knows one thing for sure,
						using <code>class="alert alert-primary"</code> can't be the solution.
						Why am i using a ton of <strong>classes</strong> and <strong>ids</strong> to style
						simple components?
					</p>
					<p>
						Lot's of questions around web developement these days, but answers started rising on the horizon.
					</p>
					<p>
						My goal is to show my solution to many many problems. First, i'll point out some of these problems, 
						than i'll give you a possible solution 
						(at <kbd>ctrl+shift+i</kbd> > Elements > Head > 
							<code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="base.css"&gt;</code>, and this whole document is just a tech demo 
							about how powerfull can it be).

					<h2>No more jquery?</h2>
					<p>
						The new version of bootstrap 
						<a href="https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/bootstrap-5/">stops using jquery</a>
						and this is the good direction. Jquery is unneccessary and we 
						<a href="https://hashnode.com/post/why-do-many-web-developers-hate-jquery-ciibz8fp801g9j3xtgx19utpe">
							really don't need it.</a>
					</p>

				<article id="classes">
					<h2>Classes classes classes...</h2>
					<p>
						In theory we have <strong>components</strong> for the most usecases,
						and <code>div</code>, <code>span</code> for special cases. In real life we have <code>divs</code>,
						<code>spans</code>, and <code>classes</code>,
						and sometimes <code>sections</code>, <code>heads</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						These days we have many many 
						<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">
							tags with semantic meaning</a>,
						but special behavior is missing.
						The layout spice still missing from these components, and this is the reason we use
					</p>
					<code>
						&lt;div class="col-4"&gt;
					</code>
					<h2> Div forest </h2>
					<p>
						My other pain is the <strong>huge markup</strong> for every single component.
						when you see 10 divs, and the result is a simple layout with a coumple of components.
					</p>

				<article id="solution">
					<h2>Solution?</h3>
					<p>
						In my opinion <strong>Bootstrap</strong> can't be it. 
						More like an <i>"extension"</i> for the default style.
						Like <code>base.css</code>, this is actually an experiment about it.
						A couple hundered lines of css addition to the default beaviors, based on 
						tagnames and relations between them.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can see, i'm that 
						<a href="">
							motherfucker</a> person, but this is the way to make fast, simple, and not ugly websites.
					</p>
					<p>
						You should use <code>classes</code> but frameworks should not.
						You have to build your layout with <strong>Grid</strong>/<strong>Flexbox</strong>, 
						but browsers should give you some default options,
						only with html tags for simpler designs.
